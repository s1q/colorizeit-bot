HELP_MESSAGE = '''I'm still a raw bot, so I'll probably break if you send me a picture in PNG. Do not do this, please. Just send a picture. And I'm not multi-threaded, so I'm doing everything in the queue. Soon everything will be.'''

But we do not do this because we are concerned about your privacy as much as you. All photos you send will be deleted immediately from our server and our Algorithmia remote disk after the colorization process.
The bot is open source but if you are worried about your privacy too many, please stop using it.'''
